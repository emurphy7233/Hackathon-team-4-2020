### Overview

During the Covid-19 crisis, animal rescue and rehabilitation organisations have been severely hampered due to the lock-down measures, meaning less direct involvement from volunteers and less funding support due to limitations on the public's personal finances. With the lockdown measures now relaxing, it is as important as ever for people to get involved in supporting these endeavours. 

### Description

The Animable Project is dedicated to providing platform for information on how people can get involved and help in a socially responsible manner. This project has been built as a collaborative effort by Team 4 for the [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) July 2020 Hackathon

## UX

#### User Stories

- *"I want to find information on animal welfare projects"*
- *"I work full-time and can't volunteer directly, but can donate monthly"*
- *"We are keen to get involved, but would like to contact someone via email to discuss in more depth"

#### 1.	Strategy

The aim of this project is to grow awareness and community support, hence keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and providing relevant information on how people can get involved.

#### 3.	Structure

The main focus of the my structure is to allow Users to quickly assimilate the information and keep them engaged till point of making contact . Short, focussed paragraphs of content information and inviting imagery. 

Points of contact are provided via email contact form, links to Organisation sites and direct donation button.

#### 4.	Skeleton Surface
