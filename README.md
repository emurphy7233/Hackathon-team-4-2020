### Overview

During the Covid-19 crisis, animal rescue and rehabilitation organisations have been severely hampered due to the lock-down measures, meaning less direct involvement from volunteers and less funding support due to limitations on the public's personal finances. With the lockdown measures now relaxing, it is as important as ever for people to get involved in supporting these endeavours. 

### Description

The Animable Project is dedicated to providing platform for information on how people can get involved and help in a socially responsible manner. This project has been built as a collaborative effort by Team 4 for the [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) July 2020 Hackathon

## UX

#### User Stories

- *"I want to find information on animal welfare projects"*
- *"I work full-time and can't volunteer directly, but can donate monthly"*
- *"We are keen to get involved, but would like to contact someone via email to discuss in more depth"*

#### 1.	Strategy

The aim of this project is to grow awareness and community support, hence keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and providing relevant information on how people can get involved.

##### Project Goals:

- Raising awareness on animal welfare NGO's and providing links.

- Informing people how they can get involved and what they can do, offering a few options.

- Provide direct contact requests via contact form

##### Customer Goals:

- Provide easy-to-read info 
- Display clear Donate-button options with secure payment
- Provide immediate contact option

#### 2.	Scope

Due to the one-week time-limitation and wide demographic of users, we've decided on: 

- A 4-page layout for easy navigation
- Simple, clean layout for easy readability
- Quickly defines the content, focus on options available and point of contact.

#### 3.	Structure

The main focus of the my structure is to allow Users to quickly assimilate the information and keep them engaged till point of making contact . Short, focussed paragraphs of content information and inviting imagery. 

Points of contact are provided via email contact form, links to Organisation sites and direct donation button.

#### 4.	Skeleton Surface

- Wireframes: clearly defined 4-page site
- Fixed navigation bar for easy reference to pages
- Main(Home) page, About (Support Options) page, Image Gallery page and Contact page with donation options.
- Contact Form
- Footer with Social Media

## Features

##### Existing Features

- Designed with HTML5, CSS3 & Javascript

### Testing

Throughout the project, testing on the responsiveness and the user interface took place by each collaborator when incorporating a new piece of content.

The links have all been manually tested to make sure that they reach their destination.

Once the project content had been completed, we have tested the website on multiple browsers to see if there were any issues.

A deployment test took place after we had completed the content and uploaded to Github Pages explained in the Deployment section.

### Bugs

- .theia directory was missing, along with docker file, so replaced these by downloading correct directories and files from CI template and uploaded into Gitpod

- Some images displaying in Gipod and not in hte live site, and repaired this by correcting the file path of each.

### Code validity

- HTML - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) Markup Validation

- CSS - [W3C](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) CSS Validation

### Acknowledgments

- A massive thanks to our super-judge, Claire CI, for saving our bacon and explaining that our repo was missing a dockerfile, something beyond our scope. The choccies won't be forgotten. 

- All of the charities and NGO's that we've included for their valuable work in animal welfare and inspiring this project.

### Support

For any issue resolution or assistance, please fill in our [beautiful contact form](https://emurphy7233.github.io/Hackathon-team-4-2020/contact.html). (Feel free to donate to a worthy cause while you're there).

### Features left to implement

Future features would include:

- The donation and adoption forms being fully integrated with the NGOs so that the person wanting to donate or adopt would not have to wait for a call back.
- The ability to add photos to the gallery on the site.
- Continuous update on the about section to keep in line with the current events and to keep people aware of how they can help.

### Version Control

We used Git version control throughout the project. 
Each collaborator used a git branch when they were working on the project and then merged with the master branch once they had completed their task. 
This allowed us to make sure that if there was a conflict within the code we were able to resolve it quickly and easily when the branches and the master merged together.

### Deployment

There were a number of steps taken to deploy the website onto GitHub Pages.

1. The code was written on an online IDE - Gitpod or VS Code in branches.
2. The branch code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored on a repository.
3. The branch codes were then merged with the master.
4. Under the settings section of the GitHub repository there is a sub-heading of GitHub Pages.
5. In this section the master brach of the project has been selected.
6. Then the publish to GitHub Pages button was pressed to publish the site onto Github Pages.

There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.

The code can be run locally through clone or download.  
By opening the repository and and being in the main 'code' section there is a button 'clone or download'.  
This button will provide a link that you can use on your desktop or download as a ZIP file.
